     <h1>Rhythm(taal)</h1>
    <p>Let's talk about rhythm.

The main percussion instruments used in Hindustani (North Indian) classical music are the tabla and (the somewhat less common) pakhavaj. The tabla is a set of two drums of different sizes and timbers that are played simultaneously by tapping on them with the hands in various ways to produce different kinds of sounds. These sounds are then strung together in sequences to create different rhythm patterns to accompany musical performances.

In the hands of an expert tabla player, the tabla can make all kinds of fantastic sounds, but there are a couple of dozen commonly produced sounds - dhaa, ga, ge, gi, ka, ke, dhi, dhin, tin, tun, tit, ti, te, Ta, tr, naa, ne, re, kat, taa, dhaage, tiTa, tirikiTa. Of course, these are just vocalizations of the actual sounds produced by the tabla. They are called bol, and it is these bols that are combined in various ways to get many interesting rhythm patterns.

Rhythm patterns have names such as Teentaal, Ektaal, Jhaptaal, and so on, but the generic name for rhythm patterns is "taal." The concept of rhythm itself is also called "taal." Below are some examples of taals popularly used in various genres within Hindustani classical music.

</p>
    <h2>some basic beat cycles are:</h2></br>
	
	<p>TEEN TAAL:</br>Teental (alternatively spelled tintal, teentaal, or tintaal, and also called trital; Hindi: तीन ताल) is the most common tala of Hindustani music, and is used for drut (fast-tempo)e structure of tintal is so symmetrical that it presents a very simple rhythmic structure against which a performance can be laid.[1]. It is played on Tabla as well as on Percussion instruments. </br>Arrangement
Tintal has sixteen (16) beats[2] in four equal divisions (Vibhag). The period between every two beats is equal. The first beat out of 16 beats is called sam and the 9th beat is called khali ('empty'). To count the Teental, the audience claps on the first beat, claps on the 5th beat, then waves on the 9th beat and lastly again claps on the 13th beat; these three claps (Hindi tin 'three' + tāl 'clap') give the rhythm its name.</br></br>DHA DHIN DHIN DHA |</br>

DHA TIN TIN TA |</br>

TA DHIN DHIN DHA |</br></p></br></br>
	<p>RUPAK TAAL:</br>Rupak Tala (rupak tal) or also known as Roopak Taal is a popular tala in Hindustani music that is common in Bhajans and Geets.[1] It has seven matras (beats) in three vibhags (divisions). Unlike the popular Tintal, the vibhags of Rupak Tala are not of equal length. Also, both the khali and sam of Rupak Tala fall on the first matra.</br>BOL are:</br></br>Tin Tin Na | Dhin NaNa | Dhin NaNa</br>

Tin Tin Na | Dha Dha Tirkit | Dha Dha Tirkit</br>

Tin Tin Nana | Dhirkt NaNa | Dhirkt NaNa</br>

Tin Tin Nana | Dhirkt tktk | Dhirkt tktk</p></br></br>
	<p>KEHARWA TAAL:</br>Keharwa is an 8-beat pattern used in ragas. It has eight beats in two equal divisions (vibhag). The period between every two beats is equal. The first beat out of 8 beats is called "sam" and the fifth beat out of 8 beats is called "khali". Sam is the first Division. Khali is the second Division. To exhibit the Keherwa, the audience claps on the first beat and then shows that fifth beat is waved (not clapped).</br>BOL are:</br></br>dha	ge	na	ti	|	na	ka	dhin	na	|		
</p></br></br>
	<p>DADARA TAAL:</br>This is a Hindustani classical tala (rhythmic cycle), consisting of six beats in two equal divisions of three. The most commonly accepted theka or basic pattern for this tala is dha dhi na, dha tu na. There is a higher emphasis laid on the first swar in comparison the following two, that is, dha - higher emphasis following dhi na and again a higher emphasis on dha following tu na.</br>BOL are:</br></br>dha	dhin	na		|	dha	tin	na		|</p></br>
	<p>JHAP TAAL:</br>Jhaptal is a 10-beat pattern used in raga exposition. It has ten beats in four divisions (vibhag), of 2-3-2-3, the third of which is the khali, or open division. To follow the tal the audience clap on the appropriate beat, which in jhaptal is beats 1, 3 and 8 (the first beat in each full division). A wave of the hand indicates beat 6, the first beat of the khali section.

Series of Claps and Waves: clap, 2, clap, 2, 3, wave, 2, clap, 2, 3</br>BOL are:</br></br>Dhi	Na	|	Dhi	Dhi	Na	|
</br>				
</br>				
Ti	Na	|	Dhi	Dhi	Na	||
