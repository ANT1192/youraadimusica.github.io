     <h1>Gharanas</h1>
	 
	 <p>Gharanas have been named after the places where the Gurus/Ustads resided and carried
on with their work of spreading the Art. There are six recognized Gharanas in Tabla viz; Delhi
Gharana, Ajradaa or Merut Gharana, Lucknow or Poorab Gharana, Farrukhabad Gharana,
Benares Gharana and Punjab Gharana. By consensus, Delhi Gharana is considered as the parent
[Born in a family of music-lovers, Sadanand Naimpalli was motivated to take up some form of
musical expression. Gifted as he was, with an uncanny sense of rhythm, made him take up a liking
to a percussion instrument viz: "Tabla." He found an ideal perceptor in Pandit Taranathji who lent
free rein to his inherent capabilities. It was not long before Sadanandji blossomed into an
accomplished Tabla player and was rightly hailed as a "Child Prodigy." He won the President's
award for standing first at the National A.I.R competitions in 1963, when barely sixteen years old.
He also began participating in various music conferences alongside with recognised stalwarts. He
holds a first class degree with distinction in Metallurgical Engineering and has successfully ran his
own enterprise, manufacturing high quality Non Ferrous Castings, before reverting his energies to
his first love "Tabla". A "TOP" graded artist of A.I.R. (Akashvani) and T.V. (Doordarshan),
Sadananji’s tabla solos are eagerly awaited and listened to by an ever growing fan following.]

Gharana because it was in Delhi that Tabla first took roots under the Mughals in their courts.
Although Tabla is believed to have come into existence in the period 1200 –1300 A.D. the
Gharanas came about much later. Solo Tabla playing may have begun in the late 15th/early
16th century in Delhi. During Amir Khusro’s period, i.e. 1196 –1316 A.D., Tabla was mainly used
to accompany the ‘Khayaal’ style of Vocal musical compositions. But side by side, it evolved
independently and reached a stage where it could be played as a Solo instrument and heard and
appreciated as well. It was after this stage that various Gharanas, such as those mentioned
above, developed. The development of Khayaal singing and Tabla went on almost at the same
time and on similar lines. Hence, we find that Tabla Solo recitals are presented in almost the
same format as that of Khayaal singing.

The term ‘Baaz’ comes from the Hindi/Urdu word ‘Baajaa’, which means musical
instrument. Baaz is the style of playing an instrument. In Tabla, there are two distinct styles of
playing viz; ‘Khulaa Baaz’ and ‘B’ndh Baaz’.
</p></br></br>

<p>‘B’ndh Baaz’: In this style of playing, the sounds produced from the Tabla (treble) and
Baayan (base) have a limited resonance. One of the important aspects of Tabla playing is
greater the speed of playing, lesser is the resonating time and vice versa. When one stroke has
been played, another is played before the resonance of the first subsides. In this style of playing,
the hand on the Tabla must have a compact look with fingers close together. Kaidas and Relas
are two important compositions that can be played at high speeds with skillful coordination of
the fingers on the Tabla and Baayan. In the B’ndh Baaz, strokes on the ‘Chaanti’ (the border
strip on the Tabla top [pudi]), the ‘L’v’ (the area between the ‘Chaanti’ and ‘Shaayee’) and the
‘Shaayee’ are prominent.</p></br></br>


<p>‘Khulaa Baaz’: In this style, exactly the opposite holds good. Khulaa means openhanded, i.e. the fingers are spread out, and the hand never rests on the Tabla or Baayan giving
enough scope for them to reverberate to the fullest after a stroke has been played. One finds the
influence of the Pakhavaj on this style of playing. In contrast to the B’ndh Baaz, in this, the full
palm is used and sounds are produced more by fingers joined together rather than individual
fingers. This results in reduced speed of playing, giving more scope for the instruments to
resonate. In this style, compositions such as G’ths, G’th-Parans, G’th-Todas, Parans and
Chakkardaars abound. B’ndh Baaz is associated with Delhi and Ajrada Gharanas and Khulaa
Baaz with Lucknow, Farrukhabad and Benares Gharanas.</p></br></br>
	 
	 <p>Delhi Gharana: Among the Gharanas prevalent today, Delhi Gharana is considered to
be the oldest or the first one. Delhi being the highest seat of the Mughal emperors and having
great wealth and musicians of the caliber of Amir Khusro and Miyan Tansen, became an
attraction for musicians from all over India. They came and settled there, trying to catch the
eyes and ears of influential courtiers and also earn a living. Hence, the beginning and initial
advancement of Tabla took place in Delhi, especially during the reign of emperor Akbar. At
about this time, Khayaal singing started gaining in popularity as the Dhrupad-Dhamaar style of
singing had started to decline. The accompaniment for Khayaal singing was given by Tabla
because of its softer tones. Delhi Gharana style of playing Tabla is called the Delhi Baaz. It is also
referred to as the Chaanti Baaz because of the preponderance of that stroke sound and also the
‘Do Ungli’ or Two-Fingered Baaz. In this Gharana, there is a surfeit of Peshkaars, Kaidas and
Relas. Also, most of the compositions are in ‘Chaturasra’ jaati, i.e. in counts of four and multiples 
thereof per Matra or beat. Sidaar Khan Dhaadhi is acknowledged as the founder of the Delhi
Gharana. Some of the other stalwarts of this Gharana are Ustads Chaand Khan (younger brother
of Sidaar Khan), Bugra Khan, Ghasit Khan and a third one (name unknown), who later founded
the Lucknow Gharana, Kallu Khan, sons of Sidaar Khan, etc. Recent well-known Tabla players of
Delhi Gharana are Ustads, Gaami Khan, Inam Ali Khan, Naththu Khan and Latif Ahmed Khan.</p></br></br>


<p>Lucknow Gharana: This is also known as the Poorab Gharana, and the style of playing
is known as Poorab Baaz or Khulaa Baaz. This Gharana came into being within about a hundred
years of the birth of the Delhi Gharana. The Nawabs of Lucknow were well known for their
patronage of Arts, especially, Music and Kathak dance. The Pakhawaj was used to accompany
the Kathak Dancers. But certain compositions/movements in fast speeds could not be
reproduced with clarity on the Pakhawaj, thereby leading to its place being taken by the Tabla,
whose softer tones were also found to be suitable for the lilting tunes, matching steps and
expressions. But the Pakhawaj always scored over the Tabla insofar as the resonance and
gravity was concerned. The Tabla players of this Gharana tried to combine the outstanding
characteristics of the pakhawaj with those of Tabla, thereby giving rise to the Khulaa baaz. The
Lucknow style of playing is also known as the ‘Thapiya Baaz’, because the entire palm is used to
produce sounds as against the B’ndh Baaz, where only fingers are used. Eminent stalwarts of
this Gharana are Ustads Modu Khan, Bakshu Khan, Waajid Hussain Khan, Aabid Hussain Khan,
Afaaq Hussain Khan, and Jehangir Khan. Two other stalwarts of this Gharana are Pandit Ram
Sahay, a disciple of Ustad Modu Khan and Pandit Biroo Mishra, a disciple of Ustad Aabid Hussain
Khan. Both later laid the foundation of the Benares Gharana</p></br></br>


<p>Ajrada Gharana: This Gharana is recognized as the ‘Shaagird’ Gharana of Delhi
Gharana. It is named after a small village in Merut District of Uttar Pradesh, barely 50 km from
Delhi. Broadly speaking, there is not much difference in the playing styles of Ajrada and Delhi
Gharanas. Just to make its own impact, to show something different from Delhi Gharana, most
of the Kaidas were composed in the Tisra Jaati, or counts of three per Matra or beat. Also, the
protagonists of this Gharana made some changes in their playing style to enable them to play
compositions much faster than those of the Delhi Gharana. Some of the prominent stalwarts of
the Ajrada Gharana are Ustads Bugra Khan, Sitab Khan, (son and grandson of Sidaar Khan
Dhaadhi), Kallu Khan, Chand Khan, Habib-ud-din Khan and Pandit Sudhir Kumar Saxena.</p></br></br>


<p>Ajrada Gharana: This Gharana is recognized as the ‘Shaagird’ Gharana of Delhi
Gharana. It is named after a small village in Merut District of Uttar Pradesh, barely 50 km from
Delhi. Broadly speaking, there is not much difference in the playing styles of Ajrada and Delhi
Gharanas. Just to make its own impact, to show something different from Delhi Gharana, most
of the Kaidas were composed in the Tisra Jaati, or counts of three per Matra or beat. Also, the
protagonists of this Gharana made some changes in their playing style to enable them to play
compositions much faster than those of the Delhi Gharana. Some of the prominent stalwarts of
the Ajrada Gharana are Ustads Bugra Khan, Sitab Khan, (son and grandson of Sidaar Khan
Dhaadhi), Kallu Khan, Chand Khan, Habib-ud-din Khan and Pandit Sudhir Kumar Saxena.</p></br></br>


<p>Farrukhabad Gharana: This Gharana came into existence around the same time as the
Ajrada Gharanda, i.e. 1700–1750 A.D. The main feature of this Gharana is its adaptation of the
Pakhawaj style of playing as in the Poorab Gharana. Eminently suited to play compositions,
such as G’ths, G’th-Parans and G’th-Todas, this Gharana also introduced in its repertoire
Peshkaars, Kaidas and Relas. Lucknow compositions have come as hereditary handouts. These
have further been enriched by stalwarts of this Gharana by introducing their own characteristic
phrases. The founder of this Gharana is Ustad Haaji Vilayat Ali Khan, also known as Haaji Saheb,
as he had undertaken the Haj pilgrimage seven times. The story goes that the Khalifa Bakshuji of
Lucknow Gharana gave his daughter in marriage to Ustad Vilayat Ali and presented him with a
Dowry of 1,000 Poorab G’ths! This daughter of Bakshuji was also well versed in Tabla and later
on, initiated Ustad Choodiyan Immam Bux into this Gharana by putting her own bangle on his
hand instead of tying the traditional coloured thread (G’ndaa). Some of the stalwarts of this
Gharana are Ustads Salari Khan, Munir Khan, Masit Khan, Karamatulla Khan, Shamsuddin Khan, 
Ahmed Jaan Thirkawa, Amir Hussain Khan, Pandits Subbarao Ankolekar, Taranath Rao, Gyan
Prakash Ghosh, Nikhil Ghosh and many more.</p></br></br>


<p>Benares Gharana: This is a Gharana in which both the B’ndh Baaz and the Khulaa Baaz
are used. Tabla players belonging to this Gharana play compositions, such as the Peshkaar,
Kaidas and Relas, of the Delhi and Ajrada Gharanas with equal ease as compositions of The
Lucknow and Farrukhabad Gharanas. But their preponderance is towards the Poorab style of
playing, and they prefer to position the Baayan with the Shaayee closer to their bodies contrary
to other Gharanas, in which the Shaayee is away from the body. Also, their preference for highpitched, smaller diameter Tablas is well known. Most Tabla players of this Gharana are good at
accompanying Kathak Dance and Instrumental Music. Because of outstanding Compositions,
their Solo recitals are of a high order. There is also an opinion among some experts that their
playing style has been influenced by the ‘Choughada’, a percussion instrument used mostly to
accompany the Shehnai. Super fast playing of the Teen Taal Theka using only the forefinger on
the Tabla is a hallmark of this Gharana. Eminent tabla players belonging to this Gharana are
Pandit Ram Sahay, its founder and a disciple of Ustad Modu Khan of the Lucknow Gharana,
Pandits Bhairav Sahay, Pratap Maharaj, Baldev Sahay, Biroo Mishra, Anokhe Lal, Kanthe
Maharaj, Kishen Maharaj, Samta Prasad and Sharada Sahay.</p></br></br>


<p>Punjab Gharana: The originator of this Gharana was the son of a noted Pakhawaji. He
was born at a time when the Pakhawaji father was at an advanced age. Before the father passed
away, he left his young son in the care of two of his senior disciples to train him as a Pakhawaji.
However, as he grew up, the youngster felt that he was not getting the respect due to him as a
‘Khalifa’ (chief) of that Pakhawaji Gharana. He decided to change courses and with whatever
knowledge of Pakhawaj he had gained, coupled with his own imagination and skill, he decided
to wield the Tabla. He created new compositions and achieved such name and fame that even
his father’s disciples, who had earlier refused to acknowledge him as their Khalifa, now did so.
Thus, one finds the influence of Pakhawaj on their style of Tabla playing. One finds more of
G’ths, G’th-Parans, Todas and Relas in their repertoire. Some prominent Stalwarts of this
Gharana are Lala Bhawani Das, its Founder, his disciple Ustad Qadir Bux, Pandit Baldev Sahay -
also of Benares Gharana, Ustad Shaukat Ali Khan, Ustad Alla Rakha Khan and Ustad Zakir
Hussain.</p>
